# Stressinator: a todoomsday timer

Because we need more stress in our lives, why not make a to-do list show you how close you are to getting nothing done?

To get my Redux on, I'm following a tutorial by David Joseph Katz; however, I will do my own styling to keep that practice going. Create React App (CRApp <-- how did no one notice this?) 2 is supposed to be Sass friendly. We'll see. My goal is to do the functionality and focus on the Redux side of things first. Then I'll come back and see how easy Sass is.

That's my story, and I'm sticking with it ... for at least a few commits.

## ToDo

- look up 80s TV "only on TV ads" to pick that buy buy buy now now now style
- Make this look like a cheesy add.
- Give no phks.

## Toolbox:

- ReactJS
- Redux
- Sass

## Notes for look:

Name is Stressinator. Going for a tacky old sci-fi look.
